== ABOUT ==
FEMTO is an indexing and search system for queries on sequences of bytes.
FEMTO stands for the FM-index for External Memory with Throughput Optimizations.
This tool supports building large indexes in parallel with MPI and then
searching large indexes with a multithreaded server.

== REQUIREMENTS ==
FEMTO requires a 64-bit machine to build and test. 32-bit machines are
supported for search only. FEMTO is known to build with GCC for Linux/x86-64.

MPI is required for parallel index construction. Note that MPI runs across
machines of different endianness are not supported.

If you'd like to use MPI-parallel index construction, you'll need to
install a version of MPI which supports threads. We have used
OpenMPI 1.4.2, configured in the following way:
 ./configure --prefix=/opt/openmpi1.4.2 --enable-mpirun-prefix-by-default --enable-mpi-threads --with-threads
 make
 make install # on all compute nodes
 # To make sure mpirun and mpicc are in the path for use with FEMTO
 export PATH=$PATH:/opt/openmpi1.4.2/bin
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/openmpi1.4.2/lib

If you're using a source checkout (vs a release), you will need
GNU Autotools and Libtool.

== COMPILATION ==

Make sure you have met the requirements first!

To build FEMTO, issue the following commands:
 ./configure
 make

To run the included unit tests, use
 make check

== INSTALLATION ==

To install FEMTO in a particular place, be sure to include --prefix in
your configure line, as in
 ./configure --prefix ~/femto_install

As usual,
 make install
will install the FEMTO tools to the destination specified by ./configure.

You can also run the commands from the build directory.

See src/mod_femto/README for information about installing the FEMTO
apache module.

== USAGE ==

To build an index, run
 femto/src/dcx_cc/femto_index --tmp /path/to/tmp_dir \
                             --outdir /path/to/index_dir \
                             files_or_directories_to_index

Then, to query the index, use femto_search.
To count the number of occurences (quickly!), use:
 femto/src/main/femto_search /path/to/index_dir --count 'pattern'
To report documents that matched (time depends on # reported), use:
 femto/src/main/femto_search /path/to/index_dir 'pattern'
To report documents and offsets that matched (time depends on # reported), use:
 femto/src/main/femto_search /path/to/index_dir --offsets 'pattern'

To learn more about what kinds of patterns you can use, see
femto/src/main/QUERY_FORMAT.txt
